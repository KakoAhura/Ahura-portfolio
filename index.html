          <p>
            I am an undergraduate student at UBC pursuing an honors degree in Computer Science and Physics. Throughout my time at UBC, I have taken numerous courses that have honed my computational, mathematical, research, analytical, and problem-solving skills. Some of these courses include CPSC 210 (Software Construction) and 110 (Fundamental Program and Computation Structures), Physics 210 (Relativity and Quanta), as well as 119, 129, and 219 (Data Analytics and Experimental Physics). Additionally, I have completed several math courses, including MATH 221 (Matrix Algebra) and 217 (Multivariable and Vector Calculus). I would also like to highlight that I hold a Full Stack Software Development Professional Certificate from IBM. In this program, I have worked on various projects involving the development of interactive user interfaces (UIs) and web applications using React, JSX, and ES6, as well as back-end applications with Node.js and Express. Furthermore, I have experience in developing applications with SQL, databases, and Django.
